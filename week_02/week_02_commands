## Recap:

# Our imdb dataset has 6 tsv files:
# title.basics.tsv: Info on titles (id, name, year, runtime, genre, etc)
# title.crew.tsv: Director and writer info for titles
# title.episode.tsv: TV episode info
# title.principals.tsv: Principal cast for titles
# Note that we created a second file called "title.principals2.tsv" which splits cast into separate lines
# title.ratings.tsv: IMDB rating and votes
# name.basics.tsv: id, name of person, birth-death years and primary profession

# In Week 01, we first created an empty table named title_basics using CREATE TABLE command
# And imported data from title.basics.tsv using COPY command
# You can view necessary commands to replicate current situation at week_01_commands file


# We will enter all SQL commands into pgAdmin SQL editor
# However, SQL commands can also be executed non-interactively through psql command on the shell. You can view those commands in week_01_commands file
# And commands for other system tools into terminal window which you can open with Ctrl+Alt+T
# Note that the terminal is a program that emulates the "physical" terminals that were used in order to send commands to computers back in 70's
# The actual program running inside a terminal is called a "shell": It is a command line interpreter and main tool to communicate with the operating system
# There are many type of shell programs written for *nix and Linux environment
# The default shell in Linux is Bash (Bourne Again SHell)
# Ability to manipulate the computer by entering interactive commands into the shell is one level higher than interacting with the GUIs:
# You can control/fine tune your commands with many options/flags/arguments
# You can save those commands to recreate same steps later easily
# You can combine those commands into a coherent whole called "scripts" that runs as a non-interactive program that requires no user interaction: So you can automate everything on PC



# This week we start with
